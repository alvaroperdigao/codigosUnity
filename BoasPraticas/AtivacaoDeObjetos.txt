Para GameObject devo usar:

GameObject.SetActive(true);
GameObject.SetActive(false);


Deactivating a GameObject disables each component, including attached renderers, colliders, rigidbodies, and scripts. For example, Unity will no longer call the Update() method of a script attached to a deactivated GameObject. OnEnable or OnDisable are called as the GameObject received SetActive(true) or SetActive(false).

void OnDisable()
    {
        Debug.Log("PrintOnDisable: script was disabled");
    }

    void OnEnable()
    {
        Debug.Log("PrintOnEnable: script was enabled");
    }



Para Elementos de UI devo usar:

Image.enable = true;
Image.enable = false;
